This is a simple post regarding this awesome resource I found with many different box shadows.
[Box Shadows](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples)

This is one of my favorite finds because I am a sucker for clean minimal website designs and a lot of the times those designs includes box shadows that seperate content from each other. 

This is surely a resource that I'll be using for a long time in my personal projects and also in future public projects because the whole idea of pursing web development in the first place was to make clean, different, cozy and user friendly websites.. almost like what Van Gogh did for art. (Except Im nowhere near that level)
