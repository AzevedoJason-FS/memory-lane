Recently I've been workin on a side project that focuses on using the **MERN** stack. This project revolves around the idea of an e-commerce shop who sells movie posters.

Obviously the required tech to accomplish this successfully are **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React** and **Node.js**.
I started off by building a REST API that communicates with MongoDB where I can CRUD new or existing movie posters. On the Front-End I call those routes and populate the page by using **.map** so that I can easily get all the fields in the DB. 

I did not thorughly finish this project because I want to countinously work on it by adding new and better methods to accomplish said tasks. I would love to figure out what is the best way to store images in mongo without slowing down the pages response time; I found this to be a problem when loading my pages.
