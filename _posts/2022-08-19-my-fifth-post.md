**React Native** is a javascript-based mobile framework and that's what makes it so popular amongst big and small businesses. Ever since its release in 2015, It has been the number one choice for businesses who want to 'convert' their website into a mobile app for either iOS or Android.

The biggest factor in all this success is its similarity to **React**. React JSX renders HTML-like components like <h1>, <p>, etc. Meanwhile react-native renders native app view components like <View> , <Text>, <Image>, <ScrollView>, so you can't directly reuse your UI component code unless you rework/replace all the elements; which is fine given the amount of time one can save not rewriting thousands of lines of code.

React Native ultimately cemented itself as the number one mobile application framework because of all the cons it brought besides its javascript-based structure; Here are a few:
- Wider Audience, Platform Consistency, Reusable Code, Quicker Development and Reduced Cost.
