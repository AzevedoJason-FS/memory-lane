Recently I wrote a few words regarding the benefits of equally testing for errors as much as working code;
This idea can easily branch out into other topics of psychological challenges that one may have contrary to
code development.

Psychologically I am aware that I struggle with the idea of failing at different things in life; For example, I am equally afraid of writing a bad piece of code as I am to get turned down when asking a girl for her number out in public.. Weird.. right?
Well, when I further investigate this "fear", there are a few questions that I can ask myself, but the hardest and most obvious one that not even you could think of is.. **WHY**?

I dont know; Would be the simple answer.. and I'm also pretty sure my psychologist wouldn't know either because I really do enjoy failing because I learn much quicker doing so.  

As we reach a point between relevant and irrelevant in this post, the key takeaway is that the idea of failing may stop someone from
achieving the best version of themselves, so that's why I've always felt like becoming a developer is much more than just writting code.
